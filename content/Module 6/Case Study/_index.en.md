# Case Study: Large Financial Institution Implements OPEA for Customer Service

This case study explores how a large financial institution successfully implemented Intel OPEA to transform their customer service operations with generative AI.

## Background

A Fortune 500 financial services company was looking to enhance their customer service capabilities with generative AI. They needed a solution that could:

- Handle sensitive financial data securely
- Scale to support millions of customer interactions
- Deploy on their existing on-premises infrastructure
- Integrate with their existing AWS cloud services
- Meet strict compliance requirements

## Challenge

The company initially explored GPU-based solutions but faced several challenges:

- High costs for specialized hardware
- Difficulty scaling due to resource constraints
- Data privacy concerns with some cloud-based solutions
- Performance bottlenecks during peak usage times

## Solution: OPEA Implementation

The company implemented Intel OPEA as their generative AI platform with the following components:

1. **ChatQnA RAG Application**: Deployed to handle customer queries about products, policies, and account information
2. **Document Processing Pipeline**: Integrated with their document management system to ingest and process financial documents
3. **Custom Guardrails**: Implemented to ensure AI responses adhered to compliance requirements
4. **Integration with Amazon Bedrock**: Used for specific advanced AI capabilities
5. **Deployment on Intel Xeon-based Infrastructure**: Leveraged existing hardware investments

## Implementation Details

The solution was deployed in phases:

1. **Proof of Concept**: Initial deployment handling a subset of customer queries
2. **Expansion**: Gradual expansion to cover more use cases and customer segments
3. **Full Deployment**: Company-wide rollout with integration into all customer service channels

## Results

After six months of full deployment, the company reported:

- **38% reduction** in average call handling time
- **45% decrease** in escalations to human agents
- **$4.2 million annual savings** in operational costs
- **93% customer satisfaction** with AI-assisted responses
- **50% lower TCO** compared to the initially proposed GPU solution

## Key Success Factors

Several factors contributed to the success of the implementation:

- The ability to run on Intel CPU infrastructure reduced capital expenditure requirements
- Microservices architecture allowed for targeted scaling during peak periods
- Open-source foundation provided customization flexibility
- Security features protected sensitive financial data
- Integration with existing AWS services simplified the deployment

## Lessons Learned

The company identified several key insights from their implementation:

1. Start with well-defined use cases before expanding
2. Invest in proper data preparation for optimal RAG performance
3. Regularly update and fine-tune guardrails based on customer interactions
4. Monitor performance metrics closely to identify optimization opportunities
5. Provide comprehensive training to customer service representatives on working alongside AI

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how Intel OPEA can deliver significant business value for enterprises by providing a flexible, secure, and cost-effective platform for deploying generative AI applications. By leveraging existing CPU infrastructure and integrating with AWS services, the financial institution was able to transform their customer service operations while maintaining compliance and security standards.
