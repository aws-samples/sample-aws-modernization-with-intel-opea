## Understand RAG and use the UI
Now that you've verified all services are running, letâ€™s take a look at the UI provided by the implementation.

To access the UI, open any browser and go to the DNS of the `ChatQnA Bedrock Load Balancer`: *http://bedrock-ingress-xxxxxxx.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com* (Modify with your `bedrock-ingress`DNS URL)

In the UI you can see the chatbot to interact with it

Now when you send a prompt to the chatbot, the response will be coming from  Anthropic's Claude Haiku through Amazon Bedrock.
