weight = 20
+++

This task provides an introduction to OPEA components deployed on an EKS cluster, utilizing the configuration available on AWS Marketplace. Developers will have access to the code, allowing them to inspect and understand how the various services are running. They will gain insights into how the building blocks of the system work together. 

In particular, participants will explore how the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture functions, learning to query a website or PDF and retrieve contextually accurate answers. By interacting with these components, developers will get a practical understanding of how RAG integrates retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance information accuracy and relevance using OPEA.

**Learning Objectives**

* Familiarize yourself with OPEA components on Amazon EKS.
* Gain insight into the RAG architecture, specifically in the context of document-based retrieval.
* Interact with the ChatQnA application to query data and retrieve contextually relevant answers, enhancing your understanding of RAG's capabilities.
