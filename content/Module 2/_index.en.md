In this task, you will apply guard rails within the existing environment using OPEA to control the behavior of answers. You will learn how to implement and configure guardrails to ensure that system responses adhere to specific guidelines. OPEA provides a structured way to manage these safeguards, helping to prevent biased or harmful outputs. The lab will also emphasize the importance of using guardrails to detect and mitigate bias, ensuring more responsible and fair responses from AI systems. Through hands-on tasks, you will see how these tools can be easily applied within OPEA, helping them effectively manage response quality and alignment with ethical standards.

**Learning Objectives**

* Understand the Importance of Guardrails in AI Systems: Learn why applying guardrails is crucial for responsible AI, focusing on detecting and mitigating bias and harmful outputs in system responses.
* Implement and Configure Guardrails in OPEA: Gain hands-on experience in setting up and configuring guardrails within OPEA to control response behavior according to ethical standards and guidelines.
* Evaluate Response Quality and Ethical Alignment: Develop the skills to assess and enhance AI response quality using OPEAâ€™s tools, ensuring the system delivers fair and safe outputs aligned with specified ethical standards.
