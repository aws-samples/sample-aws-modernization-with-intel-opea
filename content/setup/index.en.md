## Getting Set Up
Before running any of the modules, the AWS environment must be properly set up. While you can deploy the examples provided in each module using the [public repository](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples/tree/main/ChatQnA) we recommend using the prebuilt examples for an optimized experience. These examples come with preconfigured settings, AWS permissions (IAM roles), and a Load Balancer to expose the services.

This step is essential whether you're setting up your own environment or participating in an AWS workshop.
